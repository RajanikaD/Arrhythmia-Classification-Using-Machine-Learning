# Arrhythmia Classification Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on the classification of arrhythmia using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to predict whether a person has arrhythmia and, if so, classify it into one of 12 available types. The project involves extensive data preprocessing, feature selection, and the application of various machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate classification results.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify arrhythmia into one of the 12 types based on the given medical data. The dataset consists of 279 features and 452 examples, making it a challenging problem due to the high dimensionality of the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be found here. It includes features like age, sex, weight, height, and other medical measurements relevant to diagnosing arrhythmia.

The primary libraries used in this project include:

> Pandas
> NumPy
> Scikit-Learn
> Seaborn
> Matplotlib

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
.

├── Arrhythmia.ipynb          # Jupyter Notebook containing the project code

├── README.md                 # Project README file

├── requirements.txt          # List of required Python libraries

└── data                      # Directory containing the dataset (if applicable)

## Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing:

> Handling missing values using imputation techniques.
> Feature scaling and normalization to prepare the data for modeling.
> Feature selection to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance.

### 2. Model Building:

> Implementing various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
> Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the optimal model parameters.

### 3. Evaluation:

> Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
> Confusion matrix and ROC curves were used to visualize model performance.

## Results
The final model achieved promising results in accurately classifying different types of arrhythmia. The confusion matrix and ROC curves provided a clear indication of the model’s performance across different classes.


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to classify arrhythmia based on medical data. The use of feature selection and model optimization techniques contributed to the effective classification of the condition, which could be valuable in real-world diagnostic systems.
